# Ani's Random Blender Stuff
A bunch of stuff I automate when I mod stuff IDK

Do whatever you want with these but just don't be a dick or whatever I'm a readme not a cop

~~I'll make an actual panel and context menu for this shit when I start not being shit at Python, Please Look Forward To It™~~ <sub><sup>orrrrr i could just figure it out immediately wheeeeeeeeee</sup></sub>

## Ayo holl'up
Gonna tweak more of these to work with BG3 as well as XIV, specifically in conjunction with [Padme4000's scripts](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/346), Please Look Forward To It™.
