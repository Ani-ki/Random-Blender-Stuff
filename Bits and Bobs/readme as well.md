# Yo uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhh

If you want to use the scripts by themselves and you're not familiar with Python, you can still run these scripts really easily in Blender by just loading the scripts provided here.

Please take into consideration that I run all my scripts while in `Object Mode` as a means to separate repeated tasks and fine-tuning tasks, which almost always happen while in `Edit Mode`. But that's just how I work and YMMV. Either way, my scripts are set up to enter Edit Mode when needed, then go back into Object Mode.

## How do thing

- In Blender, do an Area Split (eg do a Horizontal Split along the bottom of your Layout Window) ![image](https://github.com/Ani-ki/Random-Blender-Scripts/assets/56663405/dbf1ea4d-df75-46e0-ae6f-239ccf7b4c36)
- Make that new area a Text Editor window![image](https://github.com/Ani-ki/Random-Blender-Scripts/assets/56663405/78ca0866-8d34-4b75-98e6-fd6962f0e428)
- Hit `Open` and then navigate to wherever you saved the `.py` file, then hit `Open Text`.
- Hit the little Play button (`Run Script`) or press `Ctrl+P`.
- Depending on what the script does you'll either see the changes happen pretty much immediately, or you can go into Edit Mode and make sure things look good. Or an error will pop up! In which case come annoy me on [bird.hellsite](https://twitter.com/Luminiari) (fuck off with that 'X' bullshit, Elon can huff my nuts).

## But also

I don't actually know Python; I'm teaching myself just enough to make my life easier down the track so if shit doesn't work for you then like you *could* come poke me on Twitter but I may just slap down a `Works on My Machine` and call it a day so.
